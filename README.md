# Advent of Code - Python Solutions

## Setup

I'm assuming you've read the README on the main branch and have just forked and cloned this repo.
Here's the instructions again:

When you've got your own repo, make a virtual environment and install the `paoc` package:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

Now find your cookie for the Advent of Code website and export it as an environment variable:

```shell
export AOC_COOKIE="your-cookie-here"
```

Also export the year you want to work on as two digits (I don't think I'll be around for the 22$^{\mathrm{nd}}$ century):

```shell
export AOC_YEAR="23"
```

The `setup` command will now create a directory for the year you specified.
